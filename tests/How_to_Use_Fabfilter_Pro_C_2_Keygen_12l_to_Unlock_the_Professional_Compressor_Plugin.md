Fabfilter Pro C 2 is not just a simple compressor plug-in. It has many features and options that make it a versatile and flexible tool for any audio processing task. Here are some of the main features of Fabfilter Pro C 2:

- Eight different compression styles, ranging from clean and transparent to warm and punchy. You can choose the best style for your material and adjust the character and amount of compression with the Knee and Range controls.
- Advanced side chain options, including external side chain input, side chain EQ, side chain listen mode, and mid/side processing. You can use these options to fine-tune the compression behavior and create dynamic effects such as ducking, de-essing, or multiband compression.
- Program-dependent attack and release curves, which automatically adapt to the input signal. You can also manually adjust the attack and release times with the Lookahead, Attack, Release, and Hold controls.
- Beautiful and informative user interface, which shows you exactly what is going on with the compression. You can see the input and output levels, the gain reduction meter, the transfer curve, the spectrum analyzer, and the knee display. You can also enable the real-time level display to see how the compressor affects the dynamics of your signal.
- Comprehensive MIDI Learn functionality, which allows you to control any parameter with any MIDI controller. You can also use Fabfilter's innovative Smart Parameter Interpolation feature to smoothly transition between parameter settings.
- High-quality oversampling modes, which reduce aliasing and improve the sound quality of the compression. You can choose between 2x, 4x, or 8x oversampling modes, or let Fabfilter Pro C 2 automatically select the best mode for your project.
